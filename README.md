# Don't let my death end your life.

When I heard those words come out of my friend's mouth, minutes before she passed, I didn't know what they meant. Now I do.

My name's **Eva Isabella Luna**, and I'm a **developer**, like many of you. I'm into all of the Apple scene, seeing how far I can push my devices and even being beyond their limits when I can. You can usually find me listening to some alternative rock music and working on whatever my autistic and ADHD mind decides to work on.

You can usually find me in my Discord server at https://discord.crystall1ne.dev.
